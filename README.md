i am studying the market feasablity or actual need for a watch app that helps you manage medications (i realize there are quite a few, but this is a very simple and intuitive app concept). it will be like an alarm, in that you'll have to cancel or snooze the notification until you've tapped the button or you've taken your medication. no more wondering if you took your meds, or having to load pill holders.

the app addresses the pain point, of:

remembering to load a pill tray every week/day
manage medications and time they need to be taken

manage meds via the phone app. but works in conjuction with the watch app

price $0.99

pill reminder phone and watch app

users should be able to: 

* add or delete medications easily on their phone

* create multiple schedules for various medications on their phone

* track what theyâ€™ve taken in a given day on their apple watch

* should have a persistent notification that they can snooze if taking a med is not convenient at that time

* should have a persistent notification that they can cancel once med has been taken

* notification resets to next pill time after taking a pill

* have an alert that notifies them if they missed taking a pill/s

* reminder to refill

* simple buttons that are easy to read and interact with

* clean layout and uncomplicated design for any user

* accessibility features, sight, hearing, SIRI commands, etc
