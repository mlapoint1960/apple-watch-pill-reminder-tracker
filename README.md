i am studying the market feasablity or actual need for a watch app that helps you manage medications (i realize there are quite a few, but this is a very simple and intuitive app concept). it will be like an alarm, in that you'll have to cancel or snooze the notification until you've tapped the button or you've taken your medication. no more wondering if you took your meds, or having to load pill holders.

the app addresses the pain point, of:

remembering to load a pill tray every week/day
manage medications and time they need to be taken

manage meds via the phone app. but works in conjuction with the watch app

price $0.99
