i am studying the market feasablity or actual need for a watch app that helps you manage medications (i realize there are quite a few, but this is a very simple and intuitive app concept). it will be like and alarm, in that yuo'll have to cancel or snooze it until you've taped the button that you've taken your medication.

the app addresses the pain point, of:

remembering to load a pill tray every week/day
manage medications and time they need to be taken

manage meds via the phone app. but works in conjustion with the watch app

price $0.99
